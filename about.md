<p>I completed a Ph.D. at the <a href="http://ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>, advised by <a href="http://kastner.ucsd.edu">Ryan Kastner</a>. I enjoy working with teams to develop remote sensing technologies to understand phenomena in other disciplines. So far, this has spanned archaeology, ecology and physical oceanography. I gravitate towards problems in digital signal processing, but I also enjoy systems level development. Most of my recent efforts (i.e. my Ph.D. thesis) were in marine environments and ambient noise processing. Specifically, I developed methods to self-localize swarms of underwater sensors or vehicles using only the ambient acoustic noise in the ocean. To test these methods, I worked with <a href="jaffeweb.ucsd.edu">Jules Jaffe</a> at the <a href="sio.ucsd.edu">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> and his <a href="http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/research-projects/autonomous-underwater-explorers/">Autonomous Underwater Explorers</a>. I also received invaluable guidance from <a href="https://isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/philippe-roux?lang=en">Philippe Roux</a> who is at the <a  href="https://isterre.fr/">Institut des Sciences de la Terre</a> in Grenoble, France. I spent a year in Grenoble as part of this collaboration.
